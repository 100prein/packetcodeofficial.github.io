							I grew up in the Bronx for 10 years and went to Mali for 8 years. I started in 4th grade in Mali. Since I went there, my education improved but in 7th grade, I began to have problems. My father passed away thus my family became poor, the school that I went to was falling apart financially thus I missed out a lot of studies and I did not have support for my education. I transferred to another school to pass the state exam for 9th Grade. I passed the exam and attended a training school that was 5 miles away from home. I was able to finish only a semester. I could not concentrate on my studies because my family lacked the means to get food, clothing, utilities, and so on.</p>
